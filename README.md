web develop environment


this can compile es6 to es5 with poiyflly,


also can compile scss file to css,


handler jpg and png files' url is also ok,


I also make window.$ connect to jQuery,and can be used in all js files


also have ugilfy and source map file,remember to set false before release


watch is set true,this means I don't need to run shell every time I changes the js files


now, I can use es6 in the fucking ie6,awesome right?


usage:

'''shell
    npm install
    npm run build
'''
